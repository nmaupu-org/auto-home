Kubernetes cluster using CoreOS
===============================

- PXE and coreos/matchbox is installed using ansible
- Once installed, terraform is to be used to configure the config files on matchbox server
- Now, pxe boot controllers and nodes and choose coreos entry (wait for machines to reboot themselves)
- Locally, use ssh-agent to add your private ssh key (the one configured in terraform/matchbox-home/bootkube-install/terraform.tfvars)
- Once machines rebooted, use the exact same terraform script to bootstrap controllers and nodes.
